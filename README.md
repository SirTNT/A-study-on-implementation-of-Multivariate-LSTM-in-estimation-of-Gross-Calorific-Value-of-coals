This repository houses the data and code for a study that estimates the Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of Indian coal samples with a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We examined 89 samples from five coalfields, preprocessing their material-property measurements and training an LSTM-based recurrent neural network to quantify how each property influences GCV. The results show that moisture and ash content exert the greatest influence, with volatile matter and helium density playing smaller roles. The repo includes notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation, so you can reproduce the workflow end-to-end or adapt it to other fuel-quality datasets.
